### 1.  White Christmas ###

Q. Did you learn anything by watching the video?
> I liked the way Professor Skiena was doing a brainstorming session with all the team members regarding the project and it is very helpful when it comes to learning multiple approaches for a given problem and how to direct the thought process in the right direction. 
      Also we got to learn that – the bigger the data-set, the higher chances of us having an accuracy in the final prediction. It is also important that we need to have select the right features for the weather prediction – like the minimum and maximum temperatures, inches of snowfall etc. 

Q. What did you learn from looking at their project report? 
> There could be ambiguity sometimes regarding what parameters to consider which need to be resolved initially, like here they had to finalize what is the exact definition of White Christmas. 
      I also got to learn how to select features for the prediction and prediction needs a lot of parameters to be considered in the final prediction whether a White Christmas would be observed or not. 
      For the baseline model, the team took into consideration the last 100 Christmas days of all state’s capitals whether they were white Christmas or not, and then improved in the future models based on some other features like coordinates of the area, correlation between temperature and snow depth etc. 

Q. What could we do to make the videos better, and more educational?
> The result was not clearly explained, there should have been a detailed comparison of cities predicted versus the actual cities which experienced the White Christmas – rather than just the number of cities who experienced White Christmas. 
      Also, the quality of video while shooting could have been improved since there were times when the audio wasn’t clearly audible. Also, there were some new terms which were introduced in the videos, they could have been explained in a better way which would have helped in understanding the video even faster.

### 2. Predicting the playoffs ###

Q. Did you learn anything by watching the video?
> Yes. The algorithms used by the team to generate the prediction in the baseline model is amazing, since the challenge was to get the point differences also, which means an efficient algorithm would be needed to get the point differences predicted with high accuracy. 
      The algorithm has been explained well by one of the team members, with a great example to understand the things in a simple way. For the college championship winners, they had even more challenges to predict the winner since they were knockout games, so it was difficult to correctly predict which two teams would be present after a round of matches. 
      This video basically helped me understand the problems that we could face while making a prediction, and how to get solutions and the thought process on attacking such type of situations. 

Q. What did you learn from looking at their project report? 
> The three methods – point score difference, linear regression and page rank model were discussed in the report with a detailed explanation of the various equations being used and how they are being used to predict the games outcome. 
      The report mentions how the regression model was trained – by having a training set which consists of all the available data till that game was played. The Page Rank model – which was used to rank websites – has been similar used to rank the football teams and finally predict the winner of NFL and college championship.
  
Q. What could we do to make the videos better, and more educational?
> The sport of American football was new to all the team members, so the professor could have considered a sport that everyone has common knowledge on and is played worldwide – like Soccer or Badminton etc.
Also, the team members could have mentioned the major challenges they faced in deciding the final parameters for the prediction since almost everyone was new to this sport and its rules.

### 3. The Art of the Auction ###

Q. Did you learn anything by watching the video?
> I had very less knowledge on why the paintings were sold so expensive – but by the end of the video I understood why the paintings have such an expensive price tag, and how features have been selected to predict the price of the painting. 
      The team has taken into consideration a lot of features to predict the prices by considering the paintings image as well as the artists. I liked the way the team used Google N-gram analysis also for the popularity of artists over the years and how the prices of their paintings was increasing.   

Q. What did you learn from looking at their project report? 
> The team has used three techniques – Linear Regression, KNN and Decision Tree Regression to predict the prices of paintings. The team has considered a lot of features of paintings, artists and images to make their final prediction. 
      They have also mentioned why the selected features are important in predicting the auction price. I have learnt that there are a lot of things that go into the thinking for predicting the auction price. 

Q. What could we do to make the videos better, and more educational?
> The video gave a basic over view of what methods and techniques the students used to implement this project. The video should have given more details about why those three techniques were only used and why not others. 
      Also the team could have spoken about the challenges they faced while gathering the data and finalizing the parameters. The video also lacks the range of error for the prediction, like the students predicted the price to be 32 million and the actual price was 30 million – how did they decide the range of error, could have been explained in a more detailed way.

### 4. Winning the Baby Pool ###

Q. Did you learn anything by watching the video?
> There are a lot of parameters need to be considered while predicting birth – is woman a smoker, if she has any diseases(like diabetes), age group, their origin race, medical history etc. 
      If you round off values of weights you are going to lose 10% of the data prediction results – so don’t round off values – since it doesn’t generate an accurate prediction. You need to look hard for dataset and eventually you are going to find dataset to help in your prediction of results. 
      Predicting the new born’s weight involves a lot of parameters – a large number of parameters which I was unaware of. 

Q. What did you learn from looking at their project report? 
> The team used various models like KNN, Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest for prediction of weight of new born baby. Amongst all these models Random Forest Regressor was the model that predicted the best result. 
      The report also compares the error distribution for the various models they took into consideration and explains why they selected Random Forest Regressor amongst so many models. The team’s predicted result was very close to the actual result – which is a great achievement. 

Q. What could we do to make the videos better, and more educational?
> The team could have discussed in detail why they selected those features during the final prediction and what the thought process and criteria was for the feature selection. 
      Otherwise it was a nice and real-life scenario prediction which could help for the future generations in predicting the problems a new born child could face before birth – since an underweight child could be given special treatment before hand only. 
      A nice project and work by the team in getting almost error free data prediction for the weight of the child.
